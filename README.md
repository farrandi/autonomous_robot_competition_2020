## Structure

* `lab_##`: Code used for weekly ENPH 480 labs (## indicates which week)
* `robot`: Code for the actual robot
* `tools`: Dependencies/other tools we use

To reduce clutter, please only push your source code to each of these folders.

## File Naming
Most of the files will be called main.cpp, so please save them to the corresponding folders.

Suffixes should be added to the end of each file to indicate whose code it is. Please add '\__initials_' to the end of your files. For example, if __John Doe__ was trying to upload a main.cpp file, it should be named
> main_jd.cpp
